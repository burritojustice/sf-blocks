# Changelog

## 2026.10.11
- `build_data.py` downloads `data/sf_streets.csv` and `data/sf_intersections.csv` from DataSF's API when they're missing; `--download` refreshes them. The dataset names, ids, and pages are listed at the top of the script. Column names are read case-insensitively, so a manual Export from the dataset page works too. Output is unchanged for the same data.

## 2026.10.08
- `build_data.py --slopes`: adds `slope_avg` and `slope_max` (percent × 10, -1 if unknown) to every segment in `streets.json`, from AWS Terrarium elevation tiles at zoom 15 sampled at five points along the block, the same way Block Party's profile chart does. Downloads about 250 tiles once into `.tile-cache/` (git-ignored). Without the flag, the output is unchanged.

## 2026.10.06
First version as its own repo, split out of civic-joy-fund/block-party.

- `streets.json`: segments and intersections from DataSF Streets – Active and Retired and List of Intersections only (data as of the exports in `data/`).
- `match_blocks.py`:
  - Between-cross-streets, block number, address, intersection, and street-only matching, with confidence and notes.
  - Cross streets checked against every street meeting at an intersection, not just the one named on each segment.
  - Streets with gaps in the city data match by position along the street.
  - Intersection points within 15 m of each other are treated as one.
  - Directional names ("South Van Ness", "West Portal") and exact names starting with common words ("Front St") resolve.
  - Intersections return the intersection CNN and a POINT, with touching blocks in `nearby_cnns`.
